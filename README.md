# Cecilia4Csound #

Cecilia4Csound is an audio signal processing environment that lets you create 
your own GUI (grapher, sliders, toggles, popup menus) using a simple syntax. 
Cecilia4Csound comes with many original builtin modules, written with Csound, 
for sound effects and synthesis.

Previously written with tcl/tk, Cecilia4Csound was entirely rewritten with 
Python/wxPython and uses the Csound API for communicating between the 
interface and the audio engine.
